### Bitcoin Knots Logo 2.0 Author(s): 

**Kurtis Stirling** (2025) created the "knotted B" shape and associated assets (logomark, logotype, full logo and short logo variations) stored in this repository.

These assets were created in consultation and rough consensus with members of the #brand channel in the [Bitcoin Knots discord](https://discord.gg/dbGqmZyc) (May - July 2025), with consideration of input from the [Bitcoin Knots community on X](https://x.com/Kurtis_NZ/status/1930023241080525238?t=1doDwyJKwF3be7s-4O--1Q&s=09) (June 2025).


_The "knotted B" shape used is a unifying derivative of previous versions:_

- **Blissmode** (2025) (thicker, asymmetric) and;
- **Skylerwww** (2025) (thinner, symmetric).

  _both independent derivatives of:_
  
  - The original Bitcoin Knots Logo by **Steven Hay** (2016)
